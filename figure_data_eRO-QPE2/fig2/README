xmm{n}_gaussfit and xmm{n}_bayblocks.dat contain the data of Fig. 2. n = 1...5 correspond to xmm1...xmm5.

The top row corresponds to the second and third columns of xmm{n}_gaussfit.dat while the bottom row data can be found in xmm{n}_bayblocks.dat.

xmm{n}_gaussfit.dat has 3 columns: 
col1: reference time in MJD (same for all entries)
col2: peak time of the eruption (in hours)
col3: uncertainty in the peak time of eruption (in hours)

xmm{n}_bayblocks.dat contains 4 columns:
col1: peak time of the eruption (in hours since MJD reference). The MJD reference is same as col1 of xmm{n}_gaussfit.dat
col2: error in the peak time of the eruption (in hours)
col3: average 0.25-2.5 keV count rate (EPIC:pn+MOS) at the peak time of the eruption (count/sec)
col4: error on col3
